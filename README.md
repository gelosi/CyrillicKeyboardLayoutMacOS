# Cyrillic Keyboard Layout for MacOS
Alternative to the flags, nice looking minimalistic keyboard layout for MacOS

Layouts are based on RU_PC lauout. Because it's nicely mapped to the English (International!) and Cyrillic hardware keyboards. Therefore, primary actions are just like on the russian mac keyboard. Alr+ letter allows to have the rest of special cyrillic lettes from Ukrainian alphabet, for instance.

Since I still haven't figured out how to support dark & light theme in one bundle, I'm using two bundles – for CyrillicBlack & CyrillicWhite respectively – only difference is the icon in the bundle.
